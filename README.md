# trainScheduler

https://jrbreckenitch.github.io/trainScheduler/

Description

This app allows the user to enter information about trains and create a train schedule. Based on the input provided by the user, the app will calculate the next time the train arrives and how long it will take before it arrives.


Motivation

The motivation behind the train scheduler was to create a app that would store information in a database (firebase in this case). Once the information was added to the database it would then need to be retrieved and added to the app. This would then allow for users to see changes when working from different devices since the information entered by the user was stored in a database and not locally.

Improvements

The main improvement I would like to add to this app is a delete function. Currently the user can't delete a train that has been added from the app (it can only be deleted from firebase). A delete function would make the app more user friendly, especially if the user entered some information incorrectly.
